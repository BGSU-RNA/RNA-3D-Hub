                  We are <a href="http://rna.bgsu.edu/main/upgrading-rna-3d-hub/">upgrading the BGSU RNA Site</a>
                  to include new RNA 3D structures distributed in <a href="http://wwpdb.org/news/news.php?year=2014#10-December-2014">mmCIF format</a>.
                  In September of 2016, we calculated release 2.0 and each subsequent weekly release.
                  From each RNA-containing 3D structure file, we identify Integrated Functional Elements (IFEs, for example, the ribosomal small subunit, the eukaryotic large subunit including the 5.8S rRNA, small duplexes, or other basepaired structures consisting of multiple chains), group them by sequence, structure, and species into equivalence classes, and from each equivalence class, we select a representative.  The collection of representatives is referred to as a non-redundant (NR) list, but note that each NR list will contain one instance of homologous IFEs from different species.

                  PDB files with no full nucleotides are not included in the
                  non-redundant lists. For example, see PDB
                  <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1DV4">1DV4</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unique and stable ids are assigned to all non-redundant equivalence classes 
                  of structure files. Non-redundant lists are updated automatically every week, 
                  and a versioning system is implemented to provide independent access to 
                  data snapshots. Full description will appear in a separate publication.
