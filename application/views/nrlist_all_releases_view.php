                  The Representative Sets of RNA 3D Structures pages organize all
                  RNA-containing 3D structures from PDB into sequence/structure equivalence classes
                  and selects a high-quality representative structure from each class.
                  The resulting Representative Sets of RNA 3D structures are appropriate for tasks
                  which require searching or training over the breadth of the entire RNA 3D structure database,
                  but which should avoid the redundancy inherent in PDB due to multiple 3D
                  structures of the same molecule from the same organism.

                  Releases are generated weekly, and previous releases are available starting from 2011.
                  (As of July 2018, we are filling in previous releases as they would have appeared,
                  at the rate of more than one per week.)
                  The default listing shows structures at 4 Angstrom resolution or better, but
                  different resolution thresholds are available for each release.
                  The set of representative structures can be viewed online along with information
                  about the resolution, experimental method, molecule name, species, and number of
                  equivalent structures.
                  Releases can also be downloaded and parsed by computer programs.

                  With Release 3.0, we modified the procedure for choosing the representative
                  of each equivalence class.
                  The representative is now chosen as the IFE (Integrated Functional Element)
                  which optimizes a combination of resolution, RSR, RSCC, Rfree, percent of nucleotides with steric clashes,
                  and the fraction of the molecule observed.
                  The intention is to select the structure
                  with the best experimental evidence for the coordinates being reported.
                  Details will be provided in an upcoming publication.

                  Individual chains are named in the format XXXX|M|C, where XXXX is the PDB entry, M is the model number,
                  usually 1, and C is the chain identifier, one to four characters.
                  IFEs are made up of individual chains linked with + signs.

                  With Release 2.0, we upgraded the BGSU RNA Site
                  to include new RNA 3D structures distributed in
                  <a href="http://wwpdb.org/news/news.php?year=2014#10-December-2014">mmCIF format</a>.
                  Some RNA-containing mmCIF structures are very large, containing multiple full ribosomes.
                  Most of the individual RNA molecules of interest occur as single covalently-bonded chains
                  (e.g., tRNA, small ribosomal subunit) but others occur as two or more chains that are
                  strongly coupled by persistent RNA basepairing (e.g., eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit with 5.8S RNA).
                  We refer to these single or coupled chains as Integrated Functional Elements (IFEs).
                  We extract IFEs from each 3D structure file, compare them to one another
                  by sequence and geometry, and group together those which share highly
                  similar sequence, geometry, and species, if known.
                  The groups are referred to as sequence/structure Equivalence Classes.
                  Before Release 3.0, the representative of each equivalence class
                  was chosen as the structure with the most annotated basepairs per nucleotide,
                  as a proxy for modeling quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Note that the representative sets were formerly referred to as
                  non-redundant lists, but in fact these lists have one instance of homologous
                  IFEs from each species, so they have some redundancy at the level of molecule.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unique and stable ids are assigned to all equivalence classes
                  of structure files.
                  Representative sets are updated
                  automatically every week, and a versioning system is
                  implemented to provide independent access to data snapshots.
